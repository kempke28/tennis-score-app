# Tennis score tracker

This is made for those people who want to keep track or record of every match or 
those who forget about the score, hopefully it will have some smartwatch functions also

The project uses "React" as a main library
and will include some libraries over the process of making this application.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. 
This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
